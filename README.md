## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Most of this build was a practice of things I learned previously. I'm trying to keep the skills I've learned as well as learn new ones in between jobs. I am also trying to get better at making my code as clean as possible. That means using comments more effectively, naming class in a way that is easily understood.

I explored a bit more with flex direction and using hsl instead of a hex code. That is still a bit new to me but I've been told it's better overall.

### Continued development

I want to continue to learn more about making my code responsive. I want to attempt to learn and implement SASS in my next project. I would like to use CSS grid in a future project instead of just relying on flexbox. I love flexbox and what it can do but I think I will challenge myself to use CSS grid first.
